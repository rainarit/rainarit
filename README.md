## Hi, I'm Ritik Raina!

- 🌱 I'm an Undergraduate Researcher - Machine Learning at [IBM AI Horizons Network](https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/horizons-network/) where I make microbial ontology classification scale efficiently.
- 👨🏼‍🔬 I have recently joined the [de Sa Lab](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/~desa/index.html) as a Research Assistant where I've been working on creating image segmentation benchmarking suites. Also, I'm furthering the development of V1Net, a novel convolutional-recurrent network.
- 🎒 I also am a Visting Researcher to [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu) where I work with model-based reinforcement learning.

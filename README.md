## Hello, I'm Ritik Raina! ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior at UC San Diego pursuing a B.S. in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning & Neural Computation. 
I currently work at IBM in collaboration with UCSD as a researcher in their Artificial Intelligence for Healthy Living (AIHL) program. I have recently joined the MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab as a visiting research scholar where I'll be working on multi-agent social intelligence. 
At UCSD, I am a research assistant at de Sa Lab where I'm working on computer vision perception.
